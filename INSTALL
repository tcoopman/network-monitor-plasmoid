How to install

remarks:
    for now there is now gui yet for setting the password and username so you have to set those in dataengine/contents/code/main.py and then build the file by hand

requirements:
    * pyQt4.4
    * pyKDE4
    * plasma python bindings
    * python 
        same version as the one of your pyQt and pyKDE bindings
    * mechanize 
        http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/
        If you have python-setuptools you can install it with:
        >>easy_install mechanize
        
download:
    * kotnetloginplasmoid.zip
    * kotnetlogindataengine.zip
    
install:
    >>plasmapkg -t dataengine -i kotnetlogindataengine.zip
    >>plasmapkg -t plasmoid -i kotnetloginplasmoid.zip 

you can test the dataengine with the plasmaengineexplorer:
    >>plasmaengineexplorer --engine network-monitor-dataengine
    
and the plasmoid with:
    >>plasmoidviewer network-monitor-plasmoid

or you can add it just as you would add any other plasmaoid (the name is kotnet-plasmoid

building by hand:
    just make a zip of the applet folder and of the dataengine folder and install the same way as if you would install the downloaded zip files

uninstall:
    >>plasmapkg -t dataengine -r network-monitor-dataengine
    >>plasmapkg -t plasmoid -r network-monitor-plasmoid
